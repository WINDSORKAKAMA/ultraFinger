    This is the ultraFinger Library. It is an alternative to the Adafruit Fingerprint Library.

    
    This project was designed to make arduino fingerprint sensor programming more accessible to 
    non-C++-like languages by offerring a C-like implementation in the source flie, C-compatible
    functions as well as a C-friendly header file. 
    

    My style of implementation was somewhat inspired by the minimalist implementation of the 
    R30X-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library.

    This is the ultraFinger Library. It is an alternative to the Adafruit Fingerprint Library.

    
    This project was designed to make programming the r307 Fingerprint Sensor on an Arduino more
    accessible to non-C++-like languages by offerring a C-like implementation in the source flie
    with C-compatible functions together with C-friendly header file. 

    I tried to implement the code in a C89 compatible manner (except the for loops)

    My style of implementation was somewhat inspired by the minimalist implementation of the 
    R30X-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library.

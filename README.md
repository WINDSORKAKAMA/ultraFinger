## Yet another Fingerprint Library?

In 2024, I decided to make my own fingerprint sensor library out of frustration due to working with the poorly documented Adafruit Fingerprint Library while working on a cashless transaction module at the 
time. 
that
Later, I decided to revisit the idea to create it ain a re-usable manner to allow it to be used in other applications.

For example, I made the decision to write this library in "C-like C++", specifically a blend between C99 and C89 code. 

Since C is cross compatible with virtually any language, and this library exposes the basic fucntionality for working with this sensor, you can,
for example, write a smart door system that uses a database interfaces and with a Python ORM to query fingerprints using a custom API that uses this library to read / write fingerprint templates / character files / bitmap images to the fingerprint sensor.

I also made the decision to use only the SoftwareSerial library for UART communication. This was done for 2 reasons:

* To ensure that the HardwareSerial ports(0 and 1) are reserved for debugging.
* To ensure cross compatibility as all microcontollers supporting SoftwareSerial can carry out UART communication with the sensor using any port.

## Features

Here is a list of the current features:

* A container for the system parameter values.
* Debugging information conveyed to the terminal.
* Verifying the module password.
* Changing the module password.
* Reading compressed images from the Image Buffer.
* Reading templates from the Character Buffer.
* Writing templates to the Character Buffer.
* Reading templates to from the Notepad.
* Writing templates to the Notepad.
* Reading system parameter values.
* Modifying system parameter values.
* Random Number Generation.
* Comparing two templates
* Searching for a template
* Getting template ID's


### Dependencies

In order to use the library you will need:

* Arduino IDE
* SoftwareSerial library
